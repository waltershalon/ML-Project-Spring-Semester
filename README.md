Final Project (Spring 2023)

INFO 521/ISTA 421

Project Overview

This project focuses on building a predictive energy consumption model to improve HVAC systems and reduce carbon dioxide emissions. The project utilizes machine learning algorithms such as CatBoost, XGBoost, LGBM, and linear regression to achieve better accuracy in predicting HVAC energy consumption. The performance of these algorithms will be compared, and their suitability for predicting energy consumption in 1000 different buildings from 13 different undisclosed sites will be evaluated.

Why the Project is Useful

With the increasing rate of carbon dioxide emissions, it is essential to develop interventions to regulate and reduce the amount of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere. Energy consumption in buildings, such as heating, ventilation, and electricity usage, contributes significantly to carbon dioxide emissions. An algorithm that identifies patterns of energy consumption can be useful for building owners and energy providers to improve energy efficiency. The project's objective is to build an accurate and reliable predictive model that can contribute to reducing carbon emissions and promoting sustainable practices in the building sector.

How Users Can Get Started with the Project

Anyone interested in working on this project can access the dataset and the code from the repository to further work on the model and create improvements. The project includes exploratory data analysis, feature extraction tasks, and the implementation of various regression models to predict energy consumption accurately.
